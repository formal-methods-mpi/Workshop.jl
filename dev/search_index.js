[{"location":"abstract/","page":"-","title":"-","text":"Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed for numerical and scientific computing, data analysis, machine learning, and more. Julia's user-friendly interface, resembling popular languages like R, Python, and Matlab, makes it easily accessible for learners. Its focus on performance, however, enables computational speeds that often rival, or even surpass, those of low-level languages such as C or Fortran. Therefore, Julia is an ideal choice for large-scale data analysis and other computationally intensive tasks, as it can be orders of magnitude faster than R or Python. In this workshop, we will introduce you to the basics of Julia and the key features that set it apart from other languages.","category":"page"},{"location":"abstract/","page":"-","title":"-","text":"This workshop is designed for R/Python/Matlab users interested in learning a new programming language or wanting to improve their data analysis and scientific computing skills. No prior experience with Julia is required, but understanding a programming language is recommended.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"CurrentModule = Workshop","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"import Markdown; Markdown.parse_file(\"../src/abstract.md\")","category":"page"}]
