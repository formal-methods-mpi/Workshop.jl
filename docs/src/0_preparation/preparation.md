# Setup

## Installing Julia

Before we begin working with Julia, it's essential to have the language properly installed on your computer.
Follow the steps below to install Julia:

1. Go to the official Julia website at https://julialang.org/downloads/ and navigate to the "Downloads" section.

2. Choose the current stable release for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux), download it, and install it.

3. To verify the installation, open the terminal and type julia. This should launch the Julia REPL, indicating that Julia is successfully installed on your system.

Now that you have Julia installed, we can proceed to set up your development environment.

## Installing Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular and versatile integrated development environment (IDE) that offers excellent support for Julia, making it our recommended choice for this workshop.

1. Download the installer at <https://code.visualstudio.com/>.
2. Once the download is complete, locate the installer file and run it.
Follow the prompts and instructions to install VSCode.
3. After the installation is complete, open VSCode from your applications menu or search for it using your operating system's search functionality.

## Installing Julia extension for VSCode

Now that you have VSCode installed, you'll need to add the Julia extension to enable language support and additional features. Follow these steps to install the Julia extension:

1. Open the Extensions view: Launch VSCode, and click on the square icon on the left-hand sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X) to open the Extensions view.
2. Search for the Julia extension: In the Extensions view, use the search bar at the top to search for "Julia" and select the extension titled "Julia" from author `julialang`.
3. Click on the "Install" button on the top of the page.

You have now successfully set up VSCode with Julia support, and you are ready to start working with Julia code in a powerful and feature-rich IDE.
