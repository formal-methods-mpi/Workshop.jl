**Chapter 0** should aready be completed **before** the workshop begins, unless you are doing it on your own.
There we guide you through the installation of the Julia and Visual Studio Code.

**Chapter 1** is the first chapter that we tackle together (unless you are on your own).
Before diving into the intricacies of Julia, we will first discuss the workflow and tools you'll need to get started with the language.
This will help you familiarize yourself with the environment, become proficient in using Julia, and empower you to troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

**Chapter 2** is meant to make the Julia syntax more familiar to you.
This is meant to help you translate concepts that you already know from other programming languages like, e.g., assignment, control flow, functions, etc.

**Chapter 3** is about things that exists in Julia.
Everything that exists in Julia has a type.
Without understanding types, you can not understand Julia.
What better why to understand than to create your own type?

**Chapter 4** is about things that happen in Juila.
Everything that happens in Julia is because of functions.
What functions do is deeply integrated with Julia's type system trough a prosses called mutliple dispatch.
This chapter shows you how to leverage this system to do amazing things, hardly possible somewhere else.
