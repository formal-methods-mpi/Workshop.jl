**Chapter 0** should be completed **before** the workshop begins, because we will guide you through the installation of Julia and Visual Studio Code.
In case you run into any issues, please contact us to help you troubleshoot.

**Chapter 1** is the first chapter that we tackle together.
Before diving into the intricacies of Julia, we will first discuss the workflow and tools you'll need to get started with the language.
This will help you familiarize yourself with the environment, become proficient in using Julia, and empower you to troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

**Chapter 2** is meant to bridge the gap between Julia and the programming languages you are already familiar with.
We will guide you through translating key concepts — such as assignment, control flow, and functions — from other languages into Julia.

**Chapter 3** is about exploring Julia's Type System, because everything that exists in Julia has a type.
To truly understand Julia, you must understand types, and what better way to understand than to create your own type?

**Chapter 4** is about functions and their interplay with types, because everything that happens in Julia, happens because of functions acting on types.
The way Julia implements this interplay is what makes Julia so powerful, and sets it apart from other languages.
This chapter will help you understand this feature — called "multiple dispatch" — and how to leverage it to do amazing things.
