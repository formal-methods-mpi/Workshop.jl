# Use Juliaup for Julia Version Management
If you're comfortable using the shell and already have some experience with the terminal, you may want to install Juliaup, a powerful cross-platform Julia installer.
It helps you to manage multiple versions of the Julia programming language and you'll be notified when a new version becomes available.
To install Juliaup, check out the [Juliaup GitHub page](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup).
After the installation just execute `juliaup add release` in your terminal and you're ready to go.
