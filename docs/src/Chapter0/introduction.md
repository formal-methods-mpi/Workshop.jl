# Workflow

On the following pages, you will learn how to use julia (installation, setup, loading packages, creating scripts, etc.)
If you are an in-person participant in this workshop, you should have received a mail prior to the workshop to complete the [Setup](@ref) instructions.
If so, you can skip this part and continue with [Working with Julia in VSCode](@ref).
If you are doing the workshop online or were too lazy to follow the mailed instructions, you should proceed with [Setup](@ref).
