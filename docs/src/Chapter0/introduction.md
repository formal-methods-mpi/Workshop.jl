Title: Getting Started with Julia: Workflow and Tools

# Introduction

TODO Question: What specific tasks are designated to be completed before, during, and after the workshop, and what are our expectations for participants in each phase?

Welcome to our Julia workshop! In this session, we will explore the powerful and versatile world of Julia, a high-performance programming language for technical computing.
Julia is known for its ease of use, speed, and flexibility, making it a popular choice among developers, data scientists, and researchers.

As this is an asynchronous workshop, you might be reading this before, during, or after the workshop. Regardless of when you're engaging with the material, we hope you'll find this workshop useful and informative.

To ensure a smooth learning experience, we have divided the workshop into three main stages: pre-workshop preparation, hands-on activities during the workshop, and post-workshop exploration.

## Pre-workshop preparation:
Before diving into the intricacies of Julia, we will first discuss the workflow and tools you'll need to get started with the language.
This will help you familiarize yourself with the environment, become proficient in using Julia, and empower you to troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.
## During the workshop:
We will focus on setting up your Julia environment, working with Julia in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and the terminal, and following best practices for efficient and collaborative coding.
Through hands-on activities, you'll gain practical experience to reinforce your understanding of the concepts.
## Post-workshop exploration:
After the workshop, we encourage you to continue experimenting with Julia, apply the skills you've learned to real-world projects, and leverage the resources and community support available to further your knowledge.
By thoughtfully engaging with the workshop content and activities, you'll be well-prepared to harness the full potential of Julia and excel in your projects.

# Setting up the Julia environment
## Installing Julia

Before we begin working with Julia, it's essential to have the language properly installed on your computer.
Follow the steps below to install Julia:

  <details>
  <summary>Advanced option: Use Juliaup for Julia Version Management</summary>
If you're comfortable using the shell and already have some experience with the terminal, you may want to install Juliaup, a powerful cross-platform Julia installer.
It helps you to manage multiple versions of the Julia programming language and you'll be notified when a new version becomes available.
To install Juliaup, check out the <a href="https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup">Juliaup GitHub page</a>.
After the installation just execute `juliaup add release` in your terminal and you're ready to go.
</details>

1. Go to the official Julia website at https://julialang.org/downloads/ and navigate to the "Downloads" section.
2. Choose the current stable release for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. To verify the installation, open the terminal and type julia. This should launch the Julia REPL, indicating that Julia is successfully installed on your system.

Now that you have Julia installed, we can proceed to set up your development environment.


## Installing Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a popular and versatile integrated development environment (IDE) that offers excellent support for Julia, making it our recommended choice for this workshop.

1. Download the installer at https://code.visualstudio.com/.

2. Once the download is complete, locate the installer file and run it. Follow the prompts and instructions to install VSCode.

3. After the installation is complete, open VSCode from your applications menu or search for it using your operating system's search functionality.

## Installing Julia extension for VSCode:
Now that you have VSCode installed, you'll need to add the Julia extension to enable language support and additional features. Follow these steps to install the Julia extension:

1. Open the Extensions view: Launch VSCode, and click on the square icon on the left-hand sidebar (or press Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X) to open the Extensions view.

2. Search for the Julia extension: In the Extensions view, use the search bar at the top to search for "Julia" and select the extension titled "Julia" from julialang.

3. Click on the "Install" button on the top of the page.

You have now successfully set up VSCode with Julia support, and you are ready to start working with Julia code in a powerful and feature-rich IDE.
