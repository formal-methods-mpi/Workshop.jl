# Exercise
In this exercise, you will define a type which is (hopefully) much more closely related to your research as Pokemon.
We will continue our example from the first chapter, linear regression.
Suppose you observed your data on education, but with some measurement error (people lie about their education, or they are not shure what exactly counts into the number of years).
Of cours this is not limited to the example of education, but observing data with measurement error is a central concept in most empirical sciences.
