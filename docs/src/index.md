# Introduction - Getting Started with Julia and VSCode

Hello and welcome to our Julia workshop!

Together, we'll be exploring the amazing world of Julia, a powerful programming language that's taking the world of scientific computing, data science, and research by storm.

Julia is not only known for its ease of use, but also its incredible speed and flexibility. These qualities make it an excellent choice for developers, data scientists, and researchers alike. Let's dive into some of the key reasons why Julia is so awesome:

1. Superior performance: Julia is fast – very fast. It eliminates the need to use C/C++, Fortran, or other "slow-productivity" or "slow-prototyping" languages, effectively solving the "two-language problem." This means you can focus on one language for both development and performance optimization.
2. User-friendly syntax: Julia boasts a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy for beginners to pick up and for experts to master.
3. Hassle-free installation: Installing Julia is a breeze – no need to worry about a C++ toolchain like you would with other programming languages.
4. Advanced support for Unicode and $\LaTeX$ characters: Julia makes it simple to incorporate Unicode and $\LaTeX$ characters into your code. Say goodbye to "alpha" and "beta" and embrace the elegance of α and β.
5. Rapid prototyping: With Julia, it's easy to add and prototype new algorithms right from the start, allowing you to quickly create efficient, high-performance solutions.
6. Built-in project management and reproducibility: Julia's standard library includes robust tools for project management and creating reproducible environments. This makes it much easier to manage your codebase and collaborate with others.

## Workshop overview

As this is an asynchronous workshop, you might be reading this before, during, or after the workshop. Regardless of when you're engaging with the material, we hope you'll find this workshop useful and informative.

To ensure a smooth learning experience, we have divided the workshop into three main stages: pre-workshop preparation, hands-on activities during the workshop, and post-workshop exploration.

### Pre-workshop preparation

Before diving into the intricacies of Julia, we will first discuss the workflow and tools you'll need to get started with the language.
This will help you familiarize yourself with the environment, become proficient in using Julia, and empower you to troubleshoot any issues you may encounter.

### During the workshop

We will focus on setting up your Julia environment, working with Julia in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) and the terminal.
Through hands-on activities, you'll gain practical experience to reinforce your understanding of the concepts.

### Post-workshop exploration

After the workshop, we encourage you to continue experimenting with Julia, apply the skills you've learned to real-world projects, and leverage the resources and community support available to further your knowledge.
By thoughtfully engaging with the workshop content and activities, you'll be well-prepared to harness the full potential of Julia and excel in your projects.
