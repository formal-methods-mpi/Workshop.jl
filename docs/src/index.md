# What is this Workshop about?

Hello and welcome to our Julia workshop!

Together, we'll be exploring the amazing world of Julia, a powerful programming language that's taking the world of scientific computing, data science, and research by storm.

Julia is not only known for its ease of use, but also its incredible speed and flexibility. These qualities make it an excellent choice for developers, data scientists, and researchers alike. Let's dive into some of the key reasons why Julia is so awesome:

1. Superior performance: Julia is fast – very fast. It eliminates the need to use C/C++, Fortran, or other "slow-productivity" or "slow-prototyping" languages, effectively solving the "two-language problem." This means you can focus on one language for both development and performance optimization.
2. User-friendly syntax: Julia boasts a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy for beginners to pick up and for experts to master.
3. Advanced support for Unicode and $\LaTeX$ characters: Julia makes it simple to incorporate Unicode and $\LaTeX$ characters into your code. Say goodbye to "alpha" and "beta" and embrace the elegance of α and β.
4. Rapid prototyping: With Julia, it's easy to add and prototype new algorithms right from the start, allowing you to quickly create efficient, high-performance solutions.

# How to get started

The core of this workshop consists of 5 chapters (Chapter 0 - Chapter 4) that you can see in the sidebar on the left.
You should do them in this order.
Chapter 0 is about installing julia and VScode. If you are an in-person participant of this workshop, you should have received a mail prior to the workshop to complete this chapter beforehand, and if you did so, you can skip this chapter.
The first Chapter "Workflow" explains how to use julia (how to setup your environment, write scripts, load packages, etc.).
Chapters 2-4 introduce you to different aspects of the julia language.
Each of those chapters has a "Theory" part and an "Exercise" part.
Should you be finished with all chapters and still have time left, you can take a look at the [Advanced Materials](@ref) section.
