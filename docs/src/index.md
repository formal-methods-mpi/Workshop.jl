# How to get started

The core of this workshop consists of 4 chapters (Chapter 0 - Chapter 3) that you can see in the sidebar on the left.
You should do them in this order.
The first Chapter "Workflow" explains how to use julia (how to setup your environment, write scripts, load packages, etc.).
Chapters 1-3 introduce you to different aspects of the julia language.
Each of those chapters has a "Theory" part and an "Exercise" part.
Should you be finished with all chapters and still have time left, you can take a look at the "Advanced Materials" section.
