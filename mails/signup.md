Julia is a versatile language that combines user-friendliness with unparalleled computational performance, rivaling even low-level languages like C or Fortran. Whether you are an experienced programmer or a beginner eager to dive into the world of scientific computing, this workshop will equip you with the tools and knowledge to supercharge your computing tasks.

During the first part (10:00-13:00) of the workshop, we will explore the following topics:

* Introduction to Julia's syntax and features
* Leveraging Julia's capabilities for numerical and scientific computing
* Best practices and tips for writing efficient Julia code

In the second part (14:00-17:00), you will tackle a self-chosen project in a small group with our help.
