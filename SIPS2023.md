# Abstract

*Please provide a brief (\~150 words) abstract/description of your proposed session*

# Hackathon Endproduct

*If your session is a hackathon, what is your end product? Hacks should have a clear “deliverable”—a project or product you are making progress on. If you session is intended as a discussion or brainstorming session, consider submitting it as an unconference instead.*

# Diversity and Inclusion

*How will the session leaders’ content foster diversity & inclusion (e.g., who will present, who will it serve) and how will that improve the science? Note that this response will be used in advertising your session.*

# Pre-requisite

*Please note any pre-requisite knowledge/expertise you will expect from attendees or indicate that no prior experience is needed. This information is very useful for attendees as they decide what to attend, ie., is a session most appropriate for someone who already has experience with a topic or is brand new to it?*

# Theme

*Please classify your session as the theme it fits best in:*

  - [ ] Pedagogy/curriculum/mentoring: content related to educating students
  - [ ] Skills: content providing training in particular skills or techniques
  - [ ] Incentives/culture: content related to the incentive structure of science, culture, and norms of science
  - [ ] Logistics/tools: content related to creation or refinement of new tools, databases, and methods
  - [ ] Other

# How would you like to conduct this session?

  - [ ] Fully synchronously
  - [ ] Synchronously + ramp-up (e.g., attendees have something to watch ahead of time, hack materials open early, plus a synchronous session)
  - [ ] Fully asynchronously

# If accepted, how long would your session be?

  - [ ] 3h
  - [ ] 1.5h
  - [ ] Sonstiges

# Do you have any co-leads for this session?

*This can be a great opportunity to introduce diverse perspectives to the conference and pass on skills to each other. For example, if you are a faculty member, consider inviting a graduate student or post-doc to help you lead the session. If you already have co-leaders in mind, please write their names and e-mails below. The Program Committee also will be happy to help you identify potential co-leaders.*

# Time

*What times of day (in Padua time, GMT+1) are you generally able to present/attend if you were to present remotely? (The time zone converter https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/ may be useful). Having more flexible presenting hours will facilitate more global engagement. We will use these time preferences for our online programming and in case in-person presenters have to switch to a remote format.*

# Zoom

*For virtual sessions: Do you or one of your co-leads have a Zoom pro account that enables you to host meetings longer than 40 minutes? (Note that if you do not, we will be happy to set up the space for you).*

  - [ ] Yes, I am able to host my own space
  - [ ] No, I would like to use a SIPS-maintained space
  - [ ] Unsure

# Any other comments about this proposal we should be aware of?
